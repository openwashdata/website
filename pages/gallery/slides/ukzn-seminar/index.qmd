- Very little data is shared publicly and following best practices for reuse

Data: R package washopenresearch to be published at <https://github.com/openwashdata/washopenresearch>
:::

::: {.notes}
- The first missed opportunity are journal articles and data from researchers

- We looked at the Data Availability Statements in 924 articles published in the Journal of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for Development from 2011 to 2023.

- You can see the data availability statements on the vertical axis and the number of publications on the horizontal axis

- Colors differentiate between papers published before 2020 and in 2020 or later, when a policy was introduced that requires authors to select one of the three data availability statements

- After that policy was introduced, we still found 15% of papers without a data availability statement, while 60% of articles stated that data was available in the paper, which could also be as supplementary material

:::

## Journal articles {.smaller}

#### Supplementary Material

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

[Take-away]{.highlight-yellow}: Not a single file is in [machine-readable]{.highlight-yellow}, [non-proprietary]{.highlight-yellow} file type format that would qualify for following FAIR principles for data sharing [@wilkinson2016].

[Good practice]{.highlight-yellow}: CSV file (comma-separated values), including a data dictionary for all variables/columns in the data

- We then looked at the Supplementary Material of all articles published in 2020 or later and found that have half of the published articles still had no data published alongside the article

- But, the most insightful take-away is that not a single file was shared in a file type format that would qualify for following FAIR principles for data sharing.

- That is something we are hoping to change, where sharing data as CSV files would already go a long way.

- Unfortunately, these valueble reports never come with the underlying unprocessed raw data attached. In this particular report, we could get access to treatment performance data of eight faecal sludge treatment plants across Africa and Asia

- What we get are tables of ranges instead of the complete number of data points that was collected.

## openwashdata community

### [Vision]{.highlight-yellow}

An active global community that applies FAIR principles [@wilkinson2016] to data generated in the greater water, sanitation, and hygiene sector.

### [Mission]{.highlight-yellow}

Empower WASH professionals to engage with tools and workflows for open data and code.

We are doing this through our openwashdata publishing arm, for which we developed a workflow that uses data donated by WASH professionals or available online, and re-publishes it following FAIR principles for data sharing

- The product is an R package published as a website for each dataset. We assign a digital object identifier that enables the tracking of citations of the data package and list all contributors with their ORCID iD, so that contributions and citations are linked.

- Data is documented in a way where all variables/columns are described in detail.

- And for those who do not use R, we also share the data as a CSV and XLSX file.

- To date, we have published 12 datasets following this workflow.

## Data steward for WASH R&D Center

- A fully funded 2-year position, hopefully extended to 5-years with 3rd party funding
- Job announced soon (2024-10-25: due date for submission of application) 
- Start date 15th January 2024 (to be discussed)
- Going through a 12-month programme together with data steward at NGO BASEflow in Malawi

## Data steward activities (WP1) {.incremental}

::: {.incremental}

- Activity 1.3: Identify how ethical approval for data collection differs for types of organizations (university, NGO) and types of data (quantitative, qualitative).

- Activity 1.4: Identify current data management practices and develop a draft data management strategy for organization.

- Activity 1.5: Publish at least 10 datasets of two different types that are available to the organization, following openwashdata data publishing workflow.

:::

## Hands-on workshop (end Oct / beginning Nov) {.incremental}

A the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:

::: {.incremental}
 
1. Describe how data published using the washr package follows FAIR principles compared to data shared in an appendix of a PDF or DOCX document.
 
2. Follow step by step instruction to create an R data package using the washr package.
 
3. Understand the difference between human-readible and machine-readible documentation.
