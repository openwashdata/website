  abstract = {Urban water and sanitation survey dataset collected by Water and     Sanitation for the Urban Poor (WSUP) with technical support from      Valid International. These citywide surveys have been collecting data      allowing water and sanitation service levels across the entire city to be      characterised, while also allowing more detailed data to be collected in      areas of the city of particular interest. These surveys are intended to      generate useful information for others working in the water and sanitation     sector. Current release version includes datasets collected from a survey      conducted in Dhaka, Bangladesh in March 2017. This survey in Dhaka is one of      a series of surveys to be conducted by WSUP in various     cities in which they operate including Accra, Ghana; Nakuru, Kenya;      Antananarivo, Madagascar; Maputo, Mozambique; and, Lusaka, Zambia. This      package will be updated once the surveys in other cities are completed and      datasets have been made available.},
