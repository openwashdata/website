# The Opportunity {background-color="#5b195b"}

<script defer data-domain="openwashdata.org" src="https://plausible.io/js/script.js"></script>

::: {.notes}

- We have a huge and missed opportunity in our sector
- Very little data is shared publicly and following best practices for reuse

## Journal articles

::: {.notes}
- The first missed opportunity are journal articles and data from researchers

- We looked at the Data Availability Statements in 924 articles published in the Journal of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for Development from 2011 to 2023.

- You can see the data availability statements on the vertical axis and the number of publications on the horizontal axis

- Colors differentiate between papers published before 2020 and in 2020 or later, when a policy was introduced that requires authors to select one of the three data availability statements

- After that policy was introduced, we still found 15% of papers without a data availability statement, while 60% of articles stated that data was available in the paper, which could also be as supplementary material

:::

## Journal articles {.smaller}

#### Supplementary Material

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

[Take-away]{.highlight-yellow}: Not a single file is in [machine-readable]{.highlight-yellow}, [non-proprietary]{.highlight-yellow} file type format that would qualify for following FAIR principles for data sharing [@wilkinson2016].

[Good practice]{.highlight-yellow}: CSV file (comma-separated values), including a data dictionary for all variables/columns in the data
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
```{r}

tbl_supp_type |> 
    gt() |> 
    tab_header(title = "Supplementary Material",
               subtitle = "Articles published 2020 or later") |>
    tab_style(locations = cells_column_labels(), 
              style = cell_text(weight = "bold")) |>
    fmt_number(columns = c(perc), decimals = 1) |> 
    cols_label(supp_file_type = "file type", n = "n", perc = "%") |> 
    tab_footnote(
        footnote = md("One article can have multiple files."),
        locations = cells_column_labels(columns = n)
        )

- We then looked at the Supplementary Material of all articles published in 2020 or later and found that have half of the published articles still had no data published alongside the article

- But, the most insightful take-away is that not a single file was shared in a file type format that would qualify for following FAIR principles for data sharing.

- That is something we are hoping to change, where sharing data as CSV files would already go a long way.

# openwashdata community {background-color="#5b195b"} 

::: {.notes}
- To address this, we started the openwashdata community
:::

## openwashdata community

- Launched 10 March 2023
- Supported by four projects worth 340'000 CHF (50% in-kind contribution)
- Ends in July 2026
- So many outputs to write about (from 2026 to 2027)

## [Vision]{.highlight-yellow}

An active global community that applies FAIR principles [@wilkinson2016] to data generated in the greater water, sanitation, and hygiene sector.

## [Mission]{.highlight-yellow}

Empower WASH professionals to engage with tools and workflows for open data and code.

## Objectives (Indicators) {.scrollable .smaller}

### By the end of March 2024 

::: incremental

1. Increase the number of datasets published on the website to [20 R data packages]{.highlight-yellow}.
1. Increase the number of datasets that are donated for publication to [50 datasets]{.highlight-yellow}.
1. Increase the number of people that have donated, cleaned, and published data independently with support of the openwashdata team to [5]{.highlight-yellow}.
1. Increase the number of unique visitors to the website to [10 visitors/day]{.highlight-yellow}.
1. Increase global coverage of visitors to the website to [50% of countries globally]{.highlight-yellow}.
1. Increase the number of data users who report having used data published through openwashdata community to [2 uses per dataset on average]{.highlight-yellow}.
1. Increase the number of subscribers to the openwashdata newsletter to[ 250 subscribers from 50 countries]{.highlight-yellow}.
1. Increase the number of participants in live coding events to [5 participants on average]{.highlight-yellow}.
