## Data

The table on this pages shows data that is published following our R data package workflow. Each data set comes with its own website and rich documentation to increase reusability. 

```{r}

# data <- googlesheets4::read_sheet("1vtw16vpvJbioDirGTQcy0Ubz01Cz7lcwFVvbxsNPSVM")
# data |> readr::write_csv(here::here("pages/gallery/data/data_data/tbl-01-openwashdata-datasets.csv"))
data <- readr::read_csv(here::here("pages/gallery/data/data_data/tbl-01-openwashdata-datasets.csv"))

```

```{r}
data |> 
    dplyr::mutate(pkg_name = paste0("[", pkg_name, "]", "(", link_github, ")")) |> 
    dplyr::select(id, 
                  name = pkg_name, 
                  status, 
                  description, 
                  published = date_published, 
                  website = link_pkg_website) |>
    knitr::kable()
```
