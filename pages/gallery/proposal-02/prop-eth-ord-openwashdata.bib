  abstract = {Abstract             Open science practices are quickly being scaled up with publishers, grant-makers, and Institutional Review Boards implementing new open policies, including requirements for increased data sharing across all types of research. Prior open science guidelines have focused mostly on issues relevant to quantitative, lab-based, experimental research. Qualitative and other research traditions must be considered in the further development and implementation of these guidelines to ensure ethical practices in a new era where data is plentiful and being leveraged for research and other means. This article includes a discussion of why we must consider new research ethics in this era of big data and what steps can be taken to improve research practices through a systems change framework, The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research.},

  abstract = {There is an urgent need to improve the infrastructure supporting the reuse of scholarly data. A diverse set of stakeholders---representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers---have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.},
