## Achievements in phase 1

The openwashdata community was established in March 2023 and received funding for an 18 month period. Since then, we have established a website for the openwashdata community that attracts 15 unique visitors daily[^1], we disseminate a monthly newsletter that reaches 200 people, and we maintain a community chat with 100 members.

We also established the "openwashdata academy" with our 10-week “data science for openwashdata” training programme from which 20 people have graduated by preparing a final capstone project report using their own data[^2].

Lastly, we established "openwashdata publishing": a clear and efficient data publishing workflow for datasets and code that follows FAIR principles, as outlined by @wilkinson2016, and highest standards for computational reproducibility and version control. We are in the process of submitting our developed R package `washr`[^3] to the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) to increase usage potential within the community.

## Data stewardship in phase 2

In phase 2 we will use a more hands-on approach by embedding a full-time data steward within two entities. This steward will collaborate with the openwashdata team to identify existing open data practices, formulate a preliminary data management strategy, pinpoint datasets ready for open publication, and identify datasets requiring more careful scrutiny before publication due to ethical approvals, data privacy, or industry partnerships.

The long-term goal is to introduce and eventually solidify practices that enable open data (e.g. Data Management Strategy & Data Management Plans) to the WASH sector.

## BASEflow & UKZN WASH R&D Centre & SOIL

Our partners [BASEflow](../../../partners/baseflow) and the [UKZN WASH R&D Centre](../../../partners/ukznwashrd) will receive funding through the phase 2 grant to hire a full-time data steward. We will start the 12-month training programme around October/November 2024, together with SOIL, who have separately agreed to identify a data steward within their organization.

## Sanima & Toilets For All - new partnerships

[Sanima](../../../partners/sanima) and [Toilets For All](../../../partners/toiletsforall) have joined our vision for openwashdata. We have established new partnerships and are excited to explore how we can collaborate going forward. 

# Are you interested, too?

If you or your organization works in WASH and would like to join the data stewardship network, [email us](mailto:ghe@mavt.ethz.ch?subject=data%20stewardship%20network). We look forward to hearing from you!
