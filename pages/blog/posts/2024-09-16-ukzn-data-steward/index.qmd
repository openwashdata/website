## Project background

The openwashdata community was established in 2023 with the vision for an active global community
that applies FAIR principles to data generated in the greater water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH)
sector. The project is managed by the Global Health Engineering group at ETH Zurich and in its first 1.5
years developed a 10-week "data science for openwashdata'' training programme and established a
clear and efficient data publishing workflow for datasets and code that follows FAIR principles and
highest standards for computational reproducibility and version control.

The UKZN WASH R&D Centre at UKZN is a strategic partner for a follow-up project on data stewardship.
However, over the years, the WASH R&D Centre has amassed a significant amount of data on WASH
related topics, including data from the Sanitation Engineering Field-Testing (EFT) Platform and the
broader research community.

The goal of the project is to publish this historical data for wider use of the community. The
openwashdata team will provide supervision and training for aspects of data management, including
data management plans, data privacy, data ethics, and data publication. The training will cover
aspects of file organization, file types, and different pathways for collaboration and task management.
The outcome is an increase in WASH related data that is published openly.

The WASH Centre is seeking a data steward for a 1-year position, with potential renewal for a 2nd year,
who will work with researchers at the WASH R&D Centre and the openwashdata team on data
stewardship. The incumbent will be responsible for identifying current data management practices and
developing a draft data management strategy for the WASH R&D Centre, publishing at least 10 datasets
of two different types that are available to the UKZN WASH R&D Centre. She/He/They will support data science trainings in varying style with several different focus topics and for a variety of audiences
