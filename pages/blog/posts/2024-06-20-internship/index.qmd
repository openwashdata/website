This is an example post in a Quarto blog. Welcome!

It has a an image included, which will be the thumbnail in the overview. Without an image in the YAML header the first image of the blog post would be used.

This post is stored as a draft (`draft: true`) which results in the post not be included in the listing, site map, or site search. 

To publish the post when it is complete, remove draft: true from the document options and then render it.
