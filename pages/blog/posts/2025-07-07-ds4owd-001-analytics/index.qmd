## A Global Response to a Critical Need

When we launched the first [**Data Science for Open WASH Data (ds4owd)**](https://ds4owd-001.github.io/website/) course in October 2023, **235 WASH professionals** from around the world signed up—validating our belief that this community is eager to acquire data science skills.

The diverse backgrounds of those who registered told a compelling story about the universal need for better data practices within the WASH sector that can facilitate collaborations between organizations and across countries.

## The Data Reality Check

Our pre-course survey revealed exactly what we suspected: WASH professionals are generating valuable data but struggling with sharing and management. Most of the potential participants were storing data in inadequate formats without standardized workflows for collaboration or sharing.

Even more telling was the programming experience landscape. While participants brought diverse professional expertise, many were starting their coding journey from scratch.

## From Learning to Application

Of the 235 initial registrants, **65 participants completed at least half of the modules**—a testament to both the course's rigor and participants' commitment. But completion rates only tell part of the story.

The real success lies in the transformation we measured through our post-course assessments. Participants didn't just learn tools—they gained confidence in applying them to real-world challenges: 

- **72%** rated themselves as competent R users
- **52%** felt competent using Git and GitHub for version control
- **72%** expressed confidence applying course skills to real-world projects

The most exciting outcome? Many graduates began publishing their own data packages using the workflow provided by our package [`washr`](https://global-health-engineering.github.io/ghedatapublishing/), embracing [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) principles and contributing to the growing ecosystem of open WASH data.

## The Impact Beyond Numbers

Our [capstone projects](https://openwashdata.org/pages/academy/graduates/) became showcases of practical application of the learning of the course. These weren't just assignments; they are valuable data contibutions to the WASH community.

One participant noted: *" (What I liked about the course was) the fact that it introduced me to a field (Data Science) that I just used to hear about, little did I know it was valuable in my career path..."*

## What's Next: ds4owd-002

The success of our first iteration has energized us for round two. **ds4owd-002 will run from September to December 2024**, building on lessons learned while maintaining the core elements that made the first course successful.

Whether you're managing water quality data in spreadsheets or leading multi-country WASH programs, this course offers a pathway to becoming a more effective, data-savvy professional.

The people who signed up for our first course weren't just registering for learning—they were joining a movement toward more open, collaborative WASH practice. When we share data effectively, we accelerate progress toward universal access to water and sanitation.
