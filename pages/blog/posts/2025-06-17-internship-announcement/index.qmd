## Background

As part of our Open Science team you will support us in developing efficient data cleaning processes, comprehensible visualizations, and teaching events that provide an inclusive and safe learning environment. Your efforts will primarily focus on projects related to our openwashdata community, funded by the [Open Research Data Program of the ETH Board](https://open-research-data-portal.ch/). Details can be found at <https://openwashdata.org>.

## Profile

This job is for you if:

- [you are enrolled in an MSc programme at ETH Zurich and are planning to take a holiday term or have already completed your degree work]{.highlight-yellow}
- you care about data and code being reusable
- you have been taught standard data science tools (e.g., Git, GitHub, R, Python, RStudio IDE, VS Code, etc.)
- you can clean, visualize, and communicate data using R, and ideally, the collection of R tidyverse packages
- you are looking for some hands-on data science experience

## What's in it for you

Everyone is welcome here, just as they are. Our collegial and respectful interaction creates a pleasant working atmosphere and room for new ideas. In addition to a central work location in Zurich with plenty of room and sun in your office, you can work occasionally from home. The employment conditions follow the university guidelines. They include, for example, five weeks of vacation per year and a salary of 3,000 CHF per month at 100%. Read an experience report of a completed internship:
