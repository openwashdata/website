  abstract = {. Central values of science are, among others, transparency, verifiability, replicability, and openness. The currently very prominent Open Science (OS) movement supports these values. Among its most important principles are open methodology (comprehensive and useful documentation of methods and materials used), open access to published research output, and open data (making collected data available for re-analyses). We here present a survey conducted among members of the German Psychological Society (N~=~337), in which we applied a mixed-methods approach (quantitative and qualitative data) to assess attitudes toward OS in general and toward data sharing more specifically. Attitudes toward OS were distinguished into positive expectations (``hopes'') and negative expectations (``fears''). These were un-correlated. There were generally more hopes associated with OS and data sharing than fears. Both hopes and fears were highest among early career researchers and lowest among professors. The analysis of the open answers revealed that generally positive attitudes toward data sharing (especially sharing of data related to a published article) are somewhat diminished by cost/benefit considerations. The results are discussed with respect to individual researchers' behavior and with respect to structural changes in the research system.},

  abstract = {Data documentation in psychology lags behind not only many other disciplines, but also basic standards of usefulness. Psychological scientists often prefer to invest the time and effort that would be necessary to document existing data well in other duties, such as writing and collecting more data. Codebooks therefore tend to be unstandardized and stored in proprietary formats, and they are rarely properly indexed in search engines. This means that rich data sets are sometimes used only once\textemdash by their creators\textemdash and left to disappear into oblivion. Even if they can find an existing data set, researchers are unlikely to publish analyses based on it if they cannot be confident that they understand it well enough. My codebook package makes it easier to generate rich metadata in human- and machine-readable codebooks. It uses metadata from existing sources and automates some tedious tasks, such as documenting psychological scales and reliabilities, summarizing descriptive statistics, and identifying patterns of missingness. The codebook R package and Web app make it possible to generate a rich codebook in a few minutes and just three clicks. Over time, its use could lead to psychological data becoming findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable, thereby reducing research waste and benefiting both its users and the scientific community as a whole.},

  abstract = {Dramatic changes to the transparency, rigor, reproducibility and replicability of research practices have occurred in the last decade. Despite considerable progress towards the adoption of open science practices by researchers in many disciplines, developing pedagogy to train students in open and reproducible scholarship has received much less attention. Engaging students with the multiple dimensions of open scholarship is crucial to embedding sustainable change: it enables the future generation of researchers to practice open scholarship themselves, fosters lasting engagement with research, and allows them to better understand findings in light of epistemic uncertainty. Teaching students about open scholarship also helps it become a public good, thereby reducing knowledge inequities in academia and beyond. We address the lack of an infrastructure for open scholarship education by introducing the Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training (FORRT). FORRT is a community-driven infrastructure for educators that advances research transparency, reproducibility, rigor, and ethics through pedagogical reform. FORRT encompasses multiple initiatives and tools to provide educators with guidance and resources to easily embed open and reproducible practices into research training. In addition to fostering a wider ecosystem for resource-sharing and discussion, FORRT has developed a wide range of initiatives, including a seven-part roadmap to the open scholarship literature, a curated database of open scholarship materials and pedagogies for customizable adoption by teachers, and a self-assessment tool to help educators evaluate the integration of open scholarship tenets in their own teaching and mentoring. FORRT actively works towards principled teaching and mentoring, an underappreciated dimension of the scientific endeavour.},

Of central priority are proposals for improving research integrity and quality, as well as guidance and support for researchers. In response to this, we argue that there is one important component of research integrity that is often absent from discussion: the pedagogical consequences of how we teach, mentor, and supervise students through open scholarship. We justify the need to integrate open scholarship principles into research training within higher education and argue that pedagogical communities play a key role in fostering an inclusive culture of open scholarship. We illustrate these benefits by presenting A Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training (FORRT), an international grassroots community whose goal is to provide support, resources, visibility, and advocacy for the adoption of principled, open teaching and mentoring practices, whilst generating conversations about the ethics and social impact of higher-education pedagogy. Representing a diverse group of early-career researchers and students across specialisms, we advocate for greater recognition of and support for pedagogical communities, and encourage all research stakeholders to engage with these communities to enable long-term, sustainable change.},

As such, it aims to increase the European Commission's understanding of the lack of reproducibility in Europe, and help design a suitable response in the context of EU Research \& Innovation. The report identifies the key emerging issues in reproducibility; it is informed by clearly marked expert opinion (in italics), as it emerged from the scoping seminar. Concrete recommendations of possible action by the European Commission are featured in separate `Action Boxes'. Overall the report introduces the concept of reproducibility as a continuum of practices. It is posited that the reproducibility of results has value both as a mechanism to ensure good science based on truthful claims, and as a driver of further discovery and innovation. The sections includes a working definition that is conducive for policy making and thus delimits the scope of the subject. Then the report reviews recent claims regarding the increasing lack of reproducibility in modern science, dubbed by some a `crisis of reproducibility'. It explores the main traits and underlying causes of the lack of reproducibility, including bias, poor experimental design and statistics, issues with scientific reporting, research culture, career-related factors and economics. Finally, the report reviews recent activities by scientists, research funders and publishers that aim to mitigate the lack of reproducibility; and it catalogues a range of possible remedies to the lack of reproducibility as they are found in the literature. The report provides concrete advice for policy action that may increase reproducibility in three key areas of the EU Research \& Innovation, specifically guidelines; the research grant system; and training and careers},

We discuss how with careful design we have aligned collaboration with the current conventions for individual student assessment. We reflect on our experiences of several years running the GW4 Undergraduate Psychology Consortium offering insights we hope will be of practical use to others wishing to adopt a similar approach. We consider the pedagogical benefits of our approach in equipping students with 21st-century skills. Finally, we reflect on the need to shift incentives to reward to team science in global research and how this applies to the reward structures of student assessment.},

However, despite this widespread endorsement and support, as well as various efforts led by early career researchers, open research is yet to be widely adopted. For open research to become the norm, initiatives should engage academics from all career stages, particularly senior academics (namely senior lecturers, readers, professors) given their routine involvement in determining the quality of research. Senior academics, however, face unique challenges in implementing policy changes and supporting grassroots initiatives. Given that\textemdash like all researchers\textemdash senior academics are motivated by self-interest, this paper lays out three feasible steps that senior academics can take to improve the quality and productivity of their research, that also serve to engender open research. These steps include changing (a) hiring criteria, (b) how scholarly outputs are credited, and (c) how we fund and publish in line with~open research principles. The guidance we provide is accompanied by material for further reading.},

We investigate how the structure and tooling of software packages of the R programming language are being used to produce research compendia in a variety of disciplines. We also describe how software engineering tools and services are being used by researchers to streamline working with research compendia. Using real-world examples, we show how researchers can improve the reproducibility of their work using research compendia based on R packages and related tools.},

The author offers insights with regard to ideas, old and new, about science, and their historical origins in philosophy and sociology of science, which is of interest to a broad readership. The book shows that scientifically grounded knowledge is required and helpful in understanding intellectual and political positions in various discussions on the grand challenges of our time and how science makes impact on society. The book reveals why interventions that look good or even obvious, are often met with resistance and are hard to realize in practice. Based on a thorough analysis, as well as personal experiences in aids research, university administration and as a science observer, the author provides - while being totally open regarding science's limitations- a realistic narrative about how research is conducted, and how reliable `objective' knowledge is produced. His idea of science, which draws heavily on American pragmatism, fits in with the global Open Science movement. It is argued that Open Science is a truly and historically unique movement in that it translates the analysis of the problems of science into major institutional actions of system change in order to improve academic culture and the impact of science, engaging all actors in the field of science and academia.},

While reproducibility is core to our definition, most data science learners enter the field with other aspects of data science in mind, for example predictive modelling, which is often one of the most interesting topic to novices. This fact, along with the highly technical nature of the industry standard reproducibility tools currently employed in data science, present out-of-the gate challenges in teaching reproducibility in the data science classroom. Put simply, students are not as intrinsically motivated to learn this topic, and it is not an easy one for them to learn. What can a data science educator do? Over several iterations of teaching courses focused on reproducible data science tools and workflows, we have found that providing extra motivation, guided instruction and lots of practice are key to effectively teaching this challenging, yet important subject. Here we present examples of how we deeply motivate, effectively guide and provide ample practice opportunities to data science students to effectively engage them in learning about this topic.},

  abstract = {Advances in computing technology have spurred two extraordinary phenomena in science: large-scale and high-throughput data collection coupled with the creation and implementation of complex statistical algorithms for data analysis. These two phenomena have brought about tremendous advances in scientific discovery but have raised two serious concerns. The complexity of modern data analyses raises questions about the reproducibility of the analyses, meaning the ability of independent analysts to recreate the results claimed by the original authors using the original data and analysis techniques. Reproducibility is typically thwarted by a lack of availability of the original data and computer code. A more general concern is the replicability of scientific findings, which concerns the frequency with which scientific claims are confirmed by completely independent investigations. Although reproducibility and replicability are related, they focus on different aspects of scientific progress. In this review, we discuss the origins of reproducible research, characterize the current status of reproducibility in public health research, and connect reproducibility to current concerns about the replicability of scientific findings. Finally, we describe a path forward for improving both the reproducibility and replicability of public health research in the future.},

Each phase is roughly centered around the audience to whom research decisions, methodologies, and results are being immediately communicated. Importantly, each phase can also give rise to a number of research products beyond traditional academic publications. Where relevant, we draw analogies between design principles and established practice in software development. The guidance provided here is not intended to be a strict rulebook; rather, the suggestions for practices and tools to advance reproducible, sound data-intensive analysis may furnish support for both students new to research and current researchers who are new to data-intensive work.},
