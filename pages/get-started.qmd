Welcome! We are very glad that you take this initiative to join the community of #openwashdata!

We hope this tutorial not only help you with a smooth set-up to collaborate with us on the #openwashdata project, but also benefit you with long-term [open science practice](https://ethz.ch/en/research/open-science.html). While we are connected with common values to have data from WASH domain more sharable and accessible, we do have different backgrounds and skill-sets. So feel free to skip some parts that are very familiar to you. On the other hand, if you find some terms or jargons confusing, like "R programming" or "", don't worry and [stay tuned with us](). We will provide more detailed posts on open data practice in the future!
