BASEflow is an award-winning Malawian organisation that is working to improve the sustainability of groundwater resources for rural populations to access safe drinking water.

During the initial phase of openwashdata, BASEflow published a dataset using the openwashdata workflow[^1] and has expressed interest in continuing the collaboration to develop a comprehensive data management strategy. This strategy aims to ensure that all shareable data is openly published. BASEflowâ€™s commitment to data transparency is exceptional in the WASH sector, where non-academic organizations typically have fewer incentives to share their data.

We collaborate with BASEflow on phase 2 of our openwashdata project supported by the Open Research Data Program of the ETH Board. BASEflow is one of two organisations who establish a data steward within their organisation whose role is to establish a data management strategy and join a 12-month programme for data stewardship for openwashdata.
