BASEflow is an award-winning Malawian organisation that is working to improve the sustainability of groundwater resources for rural populations to access safe drinking water. 

We collaborate with BASEflow on phase 2 of our openwashdata project supported by the Open Research Data Program of the ETH Board. BASEflow is one of two organisations who establish a data steward within their organisation whose role is to establish a data management strategy and join a 12-month programme for data stewardship for openwashdata. The full proposal is accessible here: [https://openwashdata.org/pages/gallery/proposal-02/](../../gallery/proposal-02)
