SOIL is a US 501(c)3 non-profit organization dedicated to promoting dignity, health, and sustainable livelihoods through the transformation of wastes to resources. SOIL has been working in Haiti since 2006 to facilitate the community-identified priority of ecological sanitation, where human wastes are transformed into rich compost critical for agriculture and reforestation efforts.

We partner with SOIL as part of our initiative to establish a global data stewardship network for the WASH sector, which is a key component of our [phase 2 proposal](https://github.com/openwashdata-dev/prop-eth-ord-explore-02-openwashdata) for the openwashdata community.
