## 👋 Welcome

This highly interactive session led by openwashdata and WASHWeb will introduce two key areas for improving the WASH data ecosystem: using existing data better and innovating on open data practices. Participants will be exposed to seven 3-minute pitches of challenges that different actors in the WASH sector face, engage in live polling exercises, and brainstorm in group discussions.
