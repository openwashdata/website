The mission of this community is to empower WASH professionals to engage with tools and workflows for open data and code. To fullfil this mission, we offer learning events that are free for anyone to participate in.

## 🎓 data science for openwashdata - 002

We're doing it again! Two years after our first iteration, we're running the "data science for openwashdata" course again. 

The course content will largely stay the same with a few distinct differences:

1. We will provide recordings of the live lectures, but expect you to complete a new homework quiz within two weeks after the lecture.

2. We will teach the bonus module: "Use of AI for coding support".

3. We are starting a mentorship programme for increased learning and support.

4. We offer language support for Spanish speakers.
