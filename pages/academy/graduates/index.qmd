This page highlights the capstone projects completed by the graduates of our [data science for openwashdata course](https://ds4owd-001.github.io/website/). To complete the course, each course participant had to conclude a capstone project with a dataset of their choice and complete a [list of requires items](https://ds4owd-001.github.io/website/project/#required-items).

Not all projects are publicly available. The GitHub repository is set to "private" without a public website.
