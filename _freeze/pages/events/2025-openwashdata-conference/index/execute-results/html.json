This internal event for the Global Health Engineering group at ETH Zurich will bring our team together to:\n\n- Showcase data steward Emmanuel's work over the past 6 months\n- Plan for the future of openwashdata\n- Host a Claude Code hackathon with Global Health Engineering colleagues\n- Go on a summer excursion around Zurich\n\nThe conference will explore new AI tools like Claude Code to transform workflows at Global Health Engineering and for the openwashdata community. We will explore this from the lense of working with software and data, but also the more research focused tasks of literature review, article and proposal writing. We will share the best use cases and lessons learned in our next newsletter issues and through blog posts.\n\n## üìÜ Event Details\n\n-   **Date:** 15 to 17 July 2025 \n-   **Location:** [Villa Hatt](https://ethz.ch/de/campus/erreichen/region-zuerich/villa-hatt.html), Zurich, Switzerland\n\n## üìù Agenda\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n### Day 1\n\n- Note (2025-07-07): Programme is work in progress and subject to change.
