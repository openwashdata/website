Since then, we have established a website for the openwashdata community that attracts 15 unique visitors daily[^1], we disseminate a monthly newsletter that reaches 200 people, and we maintain a community chat with 100 members.\n\n[^1]: [https://openwashdata.org/pages/gallery/stats/](../../../gallery/stats)\n\nWe also established the \"openwashdata academy\" with our 10-week “data science for openwashdata” training programme from which 20 people have graduated by preparing a final capstone project report using their own data[^2].\n\n[^2]: Find open reports and associated data packages here: https://openwashdata.org/pages/academy/graduates/\n\nLastly, we established \"openwashdata publishing\": a clear and efficient data publishing workflow for datasets and code that follows FAIR principles, as outlined by @wilkinson2016, and highest standards for computational reproducibility and version control. We are in the process of submitting our developed R package `washr`[^3] to the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) to increase usage potential within the community.\n\n[^3]: Find the package under development here: <https://github.com/openwashdata-dev/washr>\n\n## Data stewardship in phase 2\n\nIn phase 2 we will use a more hands-on approach by embedding a full-time data steward within two entities. This steward will collaborate with the openwashdata team to identify existing open data practices, formulate a preliminary data management strategy, pinpoint datasets ready for open publication, and identify datasets requiring more careful scrutiny before publication due to ethical approvals, data privacy, or industry partnerships.\n\nThe long-term goal is to introduce and eventually solidify practices that enable open data (e.g. Data Management Strategy & Data Management Plans) to the WASH sector.\n\nThe full proposal with additional work packages can be accessed at [https://openwashdata.org/pages/gallery/proposal-02/](../../../gallery/proposal-02)\n\n## BASEflow & UKZN WASH R&D Centre & SOIL\n\nOur partners BASEflow and the UKZN WASH R&D Centre will receive funding through the phase 2 grant to hire a full-time data steward. We will start the 12-month training programme around October/November 2024, together with SOIL, who have separately agreed to identify a data steward within their organization.\n\n## Sanima & Toilets For All - new partnerships\n\nSanima and Toilets For All have joined our vision for openwashdata. We have established new partnerships and are excited to explore how we can collaborate going forward. \n\n# Are you interested, too?\n\nIf you or your organization works in WASH and would like to join the data stewardship network, [email us](mailto:ghe@mavt.ethz.ch?subject=data%20stewardship%20network). We look forward to hearing from you!\n",
