At the moment, the data reveals a diverse global community. The report showcases participant demographics including strong African representation, female participation, varied educational backgrounds, and widespread interest in AI tools.\ncategories:\n    - academy\n    - open data\n    - learning\n    - data science\n    - R\nauthor: \n  - name: \"Adriana Clavijo Daza\"\n    url: https://openwashdata.org/about/adriana/\n    affiliation: Global Health Engineering, ETH Zurich\n    affiliation_url: https://ghe.ethz.ch/\n    orcid: 0009-0002-0589-2274\ndate: \"2025-09-01\"\ndraft: false\nimage: \"OWD-logo-20.svg\"\nimage-alt: \"openwashdata logo\"\n---\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWe're thrilled to have **124 registrations** so far from passionate learners worldwide who are ready to transform water, sanitation, and hygiene data into actionable insights! üìä\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/plot-country-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**üó∫ Global reach, diverse perspectives:** Our participants span continents, with African countries leading the way. We have 15 registrations from Ghana, followed by strong representation from Uganda (13 registrations), Switzerland (10 registrations) and Ethiopia (10 registrations). Also very exciting to see a strong female participation with 36% of the registrations. You're creating an inclusive learning environment where diverse voices will enrich our experience. ü§ù\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/plot-population-pyramid-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**üìö Meeting learners at every level:** While 70% of participants hold advanced degrees and 48% are employed full-time, 86% are beginners in R programming. This mix creates a unique learning environment where everyone brings valuable perspectives. Whether you're taking your first steps in coding or bringing years of WASH expertise we're ready to support you in this path of adding data science to your toolkit. üíª‚ú®\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/plot-education-stacked-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/plot-employment-stacked-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/plot-programming-skills-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**ü§ñ AI-powered learning:** With 100% of participants already using AI tools (most popular: ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot for Microsoft 365), we're excited to include our bonus module: **\"Use of AI for coding support\"**. This module will help all participants - from beginners to experienced coders - leverage AI tools effectively and responsibly in their data science journey.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/plot-llm-platforms-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nJoin this vibrant community committed to using data science for open research and data. Together, we're building the knowledge to tackle water and sanitation challenges. üåä\n\nVisit the [course website](https://ds4owd-002.github.io/website/) if you are interested in learning more about the contents and structure.
